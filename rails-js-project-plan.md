# Rails JS Project Plan

The goal is to add dynamic features to your previous Rails application that are possible only through JavaScript and a JSON API.

## parts to complete before review

1. project code.
2. project video walk-through.
3. blog post.
4. 30 minute video of coding.

## code requirements

1. Must translate JSON responses from your Rails app into JavaScript Model Objects using either ES6 class or constructor syntax. The Model Objects must have at least one method on the prototype. (Formatters work really well for this.)

2. Must render at least one index page (index resource - 'list of things') via JavaScript and an Active Model Serialization JSON Backend.

3. Must render at least one show page (show resource - 'one specific thing') via JavaScript and an Active Model Serialization JSON Backend.

4. Your Rails application must dynamically render on the page at least one serialized 'has_many' relationship through JSON using JavaScript.

5. Must use your Rails application to render a form, for creating a resource, that is submitted dynamically, and displayed through JavaScript, and JSON, without a page refresh.
